# Twitter Practices

## Following

- Follow related organizations e.g. R-Ladies groups, R User Groups in underserved regions, diversity in tech groups
- Follow those that follow us if they use their account to share data science/science-related content and there are no red flags

N.B. Currently we are not monitoring new individuals to follow back, this is time-intensive and we have done it periodically.

## Unfollowing

- Unfollow in rare cases that an account shows evidence of behaviour counter to our mission, e.g. targeting members of under-represented groups
- Criticism of Forwards or other community groups is not necessarily a reason to unfollow. 

*At least two Twitter moderators should agree that unfollowing is necessary*. 

## Blocking

Blocking can be more helpful than unfollowing as our account will show any blocked accounts and therefore we keep the fact that action was necessary in our institutional memory.

- Block in rare cases that an account shows particularly unpleasant behaviour, e.g. offensive tweets.
- Report the account if the behaviour is abusive.

*At least two Twitter moderators should agree that blocking is necessary*.
