# Scope of account

## General principles

- Clear link to R/data/tech communities
- Relevant to increasing diversity in R community
- Supportive and constructive
- Information/news vs opinion
    - Generally retweet rather than tweet original content
    - Summarise key content (e.g. cost, dates) from linked resources
- Accessible
    - Add alt text to images/gifs on our own tweets
    - Add image descriptions/plain text versions to re-tweets
    - Avoid excessive emoji/emoji where the text alternative is not consistent with the implied meaning, as screen readers read out the description for each one
    - Do not use fancy fonts as screen readers read out each character    

## Specific content

- R conferences and events, particularly supporting R Foundation/community-organized events
- Other data/tech events, particularly aimed at under-represented groups
- Achievements of under-represented individuals e.g. awards, R packages, books
- Notable activity of R User Groups/R-Ladies Groups/other community groups, e.g. first meetup, campaigns, content of wide interest
- Opportunities to develop as R programmers/to progress in data science, e.g. calls for funding proposals, scholarships, internships, Google Summer of Code projects
- Learning resources/workshops
- Job opportunities at non-profits/social good organizations

# Twitter Practices

## Following

- Follow related organizations e.g. R-Ladies groups, R User Groups in underserved regions, diversity in tech groups
- Follow those that follow us if they use their account to share data science/science-related content and there are no red flags, e.g. looking like a bot account, inciting hate.

N.B. Currently we are not monitoring new individuals to follow back, this is time-intensive and we have done it periodically.

## Unfollowing

- Unfollow in rare cases that an account shows evidence of behaviour counter to our mission, e.g. targeting members of under-represented groups
- Check accounts that unfollow us: this can be a sign of a bot account, or account that is no longer relevant.
- Criticism of Forwards or other community groups is not necessarily a reason to unfollow. 

*At least two Twitter moderators should agree that unfollowing is necessary*. 

## Blocking

Blocking can be more helpful than unfollowing as our account will show any blocked accounts and therefore we keep the fact that action was necessary in our institutional memory.

- Block in rare cases that an account shows particularly unpleasant behaviour, e.g. offensive tweets.
- Report the account if the behaviour is abusive.

*At least two Twitter moderators should agree that blocking is necessary*. 

## Muting

Muting can be useful to down-weight irrelevant content or accounts that we respect but that already have a lot of exposure on #rstats Twitter. This will help to surface relevant content from under-represented groups.

- Mute accounts that use clashing hashtags (this can sometimes happen with events)
- Mute #rstats accounts with especially high follower numbers
- Mute accounts from respected community members that tweet about non-data science content with high frequency

*At least two Twitter moderators should agree that muting is necessary*. Note that this will affect what other Twitter moderators can see when they are logged in as Forwards!

## Liking

- Like rather than retweet to avoid over-sharing on same topic/from same account
- Like responses to our tweets/re-tweets

## Replies

- Thank people as appropriate
- Try to avoid getting into Twitter wars
- Check whether an account is a member of the data science/tech community acting in good faith before responding.
- Check with other Forwards members how to respond if unsure
