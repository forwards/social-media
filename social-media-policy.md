# Social Media Policy

Last updated: 2 April 2025

This policy lays out some guidelines for managing the Forward's social media accounts (currently Mastodon - bridged to BlueSky - and LinkedIn)

## Posting

### General principles

Posts should be: 

- Relevant to R/data/tech communities
- Relevant to increasing diversity in these communities
- Supportive and constructive
- Share information/news vs opinion
    - Generally re-post rather than post original content
    - Summarise key content (e.g. cost, dates) from linked resources
- Accessible
    - Add alt text to images/gifs on our own posts
    - Add image descriptions/plain text versions to re-posts
    - Avoid excessive emoji/emoji where the text alternative is not consistent with the implied meaning, as screen readers read out the description for each one
    - Do not use fancy fonts as screen readers read out each character
 - Responsible
    - Make a timely response to community concerns (e.g. if a community group has concerns about an account that we re-post)
    - Obtain approval from other organizations or members of the taskforce if you are posting news about them/on their behalf (not simply re-posting)

### Specific content

- R conferences and events, particularly supporting R Foundation/community-organized events
- Other data/tech events, particularly aimed at under-represented groups
- Achievements of under-represented individuals e.g. awards, R packages, books
- Notable activity of R User Groups/R-Ladies+ Groups/other community groups, e.g. first meetup, campaigns, content of wide interest
- Opportunities to develop as R programmers/to progress in data science, e.g. calls for funding proposals, scholarships, internships, Google Summer of Code projects
- Learning resources/workshops
- Job opportunities at non-profits/social good organizations

## Interacting

These practices have Mastodon in mind, but should be applied to other platforms, where applicable

### Following

- Follow related organizations e.g. R Foundation, rainbowR, R-Ladies+ groups, R User Groups in underserved regions, diversity in tech groups
- Follow those that follow us if they use their account to share data science/science-related content and there are no red flags, e.g. looking like a bot account, inciting hate.
    - This practice can be hard to maintain with many followers, so limiting to organizations and individuals we are directly linked with (current/past members) may be more practical.

### Unfollowing

- Unfollow in rare cases that an account shows evidence of behaviour counter to our mission, e.g. targeting members of under-represented groups.
    - Consider reverting re-posts of posts from that account
- Check accounts that unfollow us: this can be a sign of a bot account, or account that is no longer relevant.
- Criticism of Forwards or other community groups is not necessarily a reason to unfollow. 

*At least two members of Forwards should agree that unfollowing is necessary*. 

### Blocking

Blocking can be more helpful than unfollowing as our account will show any blocked accounts and therefore we keep the fact that action was necessary in our institutional memory.

- Block in rare cases that an account shows particularly unpleasant behaviour, e.g. offensive posts.
    - Consider reverting re-posts of posts from that account 
- Report the account if the behaviour is abusive.

*At least two members of Forwards should agree that blocking is necessary*. 

### Muting

Muting can be useful to down-weight irrelevant content or accounts that we respect but that already have a lot of exposure on #rstats Twitter. This will help to surface relevant content from under-represented groups.

- Mute accounts that use clashing hashtags (this can sometimes happen with events)
- Mute #RStats accounts with especially high follower numbers
- Mute accounts from respected community members that post about non-data science content with high frequency

*At least two moderators of the account should agree that muting is necessary*. Note that this will affect what other moderators can see when they are logged in as Forwards!

### Liking

- Like rather than re-post to avoid over-sharing on same topic/from same account
- Like responses to our posts/re-posts

### Replies

- Thank people as appropriate
- Try to avoid getting into arguments (either with trolls or between/within communities)
- Check whether an account is a member of the data science/tech community acting in good faith before responding.
- Check with other Forwards members how to respond if unsure
- *Be careful who is cc'd on replies* - do not add to harm by replying to trolls who have cc'd other people.
